This is a reformatted version of the <a href="https://github.com/bhvsh/mediscan-api-demo">Mediscan API Demo</a> project with added support for Progressive Web Apps (PWA). It is a simple web application that allows you to scan a medicine package and see the results (i.e., manufacture date, expiry date, etc.) in a web page. 

The main focus of the original project "Real-time medicine packet recognition system in dispensing medicines" is the development of a system that can recognize medicine packets in real-time and provide information about the medicine.

This version of the project includes the ability to work offline and cache content, as well as other features that improve the user experience when accessing the application through a mobile device.
